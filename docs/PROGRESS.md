# Progress - plain language, newest first

If you only read one file in this project, read this one.
Each entry: what got done, how it was checked, what comes next.

## 2026-07-15 - Safe ownership for new files and baseline adoption (T-005)

- Done: Safe ownership for new files and baseline adoption
- Checked by: `python tests/test_structure.py` exit 0; `npm test` exit 0; `npm run ci` exit 0
- Next: Review baseline adoption ergonomics and extend sensitive-pattern configuration if field evidence requires it
- Evidence: `python tests/test_structure.py` -> exit 0
- Evidence: `npm test` -> exit 0
- Evidence: `npm run ci` -> exit 0
- Acceptance [done]: lib/** owns new matching files created after start
- Acceptance [done]: baseline adoption records fingerprints and excludes unsafe files
- Acceptance [done]: done blocks ambiguous or forbidden files before closure
- Acceptance [done]: done followed by inspect has no closed-task ownership

## 2026-07-14 - Prepare v0.9.0 release (T-004)

- Done: Prepare v0.9.0 release
- Checked by: `python3 tests/test_structure.py` exit 0; `npm test` exit 0; `npm run ci` exit 0; `mkdir -p /tmp/coderail-v090-smoke && python3 scripts/init_project.py --target /tmp/coderail-v090-smoke --mode standard --force && rg -q '^SHIM_VERSION = "0\.9\.0"$' /tmp/coderail-v090-smoke/.coderail/coderail.py` exit 0
- Next: Review the v0.9.0 local release candidate, then authorize tag and push separately.
- Evidence: `python3 tests/test_structure.py` -> exit 0
- Evidence: `npm test` -> exit 0
- Evidence: `npm run ci` -> exit 0
- Evidence: `mkdir -p /tmp/coderail-v090-smoke && python3 scripts/init_project.py --target /tmp/coderail-v090-smoke --mode standard --force && rg -q '^SHIM_VERSION = "0\.9\.0"$' /tmp/coderail-v090-smoke/.coderail/coderail.py` -> exit 0
- Acceptance [done]: VERSION, package metadata, plugin manifests, and README badge agree on 0.9.0
- Acceptance [done]: v0.9.0 changelog covers Task Switch Gate, closeout ledger integrity, and FN-029
- Acceptance [done]: fresh install smoke reports shim v0.9.0
- Acceptance [done]: full regression and CI pass
- Acceptance [done]: release review finds no package or lockfile drift
- Acceptance [done]: no tag and no push are created

## 2026-07-14 - Task Switch Gate (T-003)

- Done: Task Switch Gate
- Checked by: `python3 tests/test_structure.py` exit 0; `npm test` exit 0; `npm run ci` exit 0
- Next: Review the T-003 commits, then authorize release/push or downstream production sync separately.
- Evidence: `python3 tests/test_structure.py` -> exit 0
- Evidence: `npm test` -> exit 0
- Evidence: `npm run ci` -> exit 0
- Acceptance [done]: accepted current task closes and commits before the destination starts
- Acceptance [done]: verified checkpoint commits then pauses the source before the destination starts
- Acceptance [done]: uncommittable work writes H3 and requires continue-current or dirty-fork
- Acceptance [done]: closed-task dirty ownership blocks ordinary start and next --go
- Acceptance [done]: pre-existing unrelated changes are fingerprinted and excluded from new-task attribution
- Acceptance [done]: dirty-fork preserves one active task and records the carried baseline
- Acceptance [done]: no switch or closeout path runs git push
